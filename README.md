🚀 Just created a simple CRUD operation website using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript! 
I built a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application where you can add, edit, and delete entries.
📝 Features:
<p>✅Easy Data Management: This website lets you perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a list of people's names and ages. Manage your data with ease!</p>

✅User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate. Input fields for name and age make it simple to add new entries.
✅Stunning Visuals: The website boasts a visually appealing design, thanks to the use of Bootstrap for styling. The vibrant gradient background adds a touch of elegance.
✅Responsive Design: Whether you're using a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the website adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on any device.
✅Real-time Updates: Anytime you add, edit, or delete an entry, the changes are instantly reflected in the displayed table. No need to refresh the page!
✅Edit and Delete Functionality: Easily modify or remove existing entries. Click the "Edit" button to update name and age, or hit "Delete" after confirming to remove an entry.
✅Interactive Buttons: The "Add" button lets you input new data directly into the form, while the edit and delete buttons offer quick actions for each entry.
✅Data Persistence: The website uses JavaScript arrays to store data, ensuring that your changes remain intact even if you reload the page.
✅Bootstrap Integration: Leveraging the power of Bootstrap 5.3.1, the website's CSS and components are well-designed and responsive.
✅User Confirmation: Before deleting an entry, the website prompts for user confirmation to prevent accidental deletions.
